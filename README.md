Python Experience

My experience with Python. Coding and learning. GJM

Python, unlike other programming languages, emphasizes on code readability, and allows you to use English keywords instead of punctuations. 
Hence, you can use Python to build custom applications without writing additional code. 
The readable and clean code base will help you to maintain and update the software without putting extra time and effort.
